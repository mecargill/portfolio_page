            I chose to make a distortion pedal because I wanted to learn more about analog signal processing. Distortion pedals work by taking a signal, amplifying it, and clipping off the highest amplitude portions. You can perform clipping in the feedback loop of the op amp or directly on the output signal. In the feedback loop, you effectively clip the gain of the op amp, causing soft clipping. On the output, you completely flatten the peaks, causing hard clipping. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I made the schematic in KiCAD because I wanted to ultimately print it on a PCB. My design uses hard clipping, which makes it a distortion "pedal". I used a DPDT switch to add three settings: Pass-Through, Off, and On. In reality, my design is not quite a pedal, because it uses a toggle switch rather than a foot pedal actuated switch. My design has three potentiometers. RV1 controls the gain on the op amp. RV2 is a variable low pass filter. RV3 is a variable voltage divider for volume control.
            </p>
            <p>
            The upper part of the circuit is the power section. It is powered by a 9V battery. The op amp non-inverting input is biased to 4.5V with a voltage divider and AC coupling capacitor. I also added some precautions to reduce noise (such as C4) that I found by looking at real pedal designs. The op amp is set up to be non inverting, with the gain potentiometer in the feedback loop. 
            </p>
            <p>
            You may wonder why the diodes are placed after the variable low pass filter. The clipping introduces a bunch of harmonics, so wouldn't it be better to give you the freedom to control if those harmonics are filtered or not? That was my guess at first, but when I breadboarded it, I tried a bunch of different configurations with the diodes, and this sounded best. The sound seemed to get kind of muddy if you filtered out the harmonics after clipping, so I ended up using the pictured configuration in the final design.

                To test the design, I used a breadboard and wire wrapping. The layout on the breadboard is approximately the same as the layout in the schematic with respect to the jacks and potentiometers. However, the switch has not been implemented at this point.
            </p>
            <p>
                 In the breadboard demo video, I adjust the gain, tone, and volume potentiometers to demonstrate their effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Incidentally, when I set the tone control just right, the pedal had a tendency to tune in to a Latin music radio station.

                I added footprints for all the symbols, and turned the schematic into a PCB layout in KiCAD (the design is convoluted due to me trying to make it all on one layer at first). My plan was to print this using GT's PCB drill and laser in the Hive makerspace. However, when I went to try and use it, the drill was not in working order. I opted to make it on protoboard instead. It would be a little bit more messy that way, but about the same size. I used the type of protoboard that has built in traces in the same configuration as a breadboard. I was able to get it much smaller than it was on the breadboard.

                In the first video, I demonstrate the pass-through setting first. Without changing the amp settings (except the volume), I then turn the pedal to ON. This means that the difference between the clean PT sound and the distorted ON sound is caused solely by the pedal. Then I demonstrate the effects of the potentiometers (labeled G, T, and V for gain, tone, and volume). The second video is a demo of what it sounds like when I have dialed in the settings.

                Overall, I was happy with the way this project turned out. It functioned better than I thought it would. I would have liked for it to have a foot pedal switch, but I doubt I will be using it for any live performance.

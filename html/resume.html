            <h2>More Details</h2>
            
            <h3>Education</h3>

            <p>
            I am in the third year of my EE degree at Georgia Tech. I also am completing a physics minor. I have taken
            classes in FPGA development, programming, and signal processing.
            </p>

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>
                Most recently, I have been working as an intern at GTRI. I have been assisting with the test and verification of spaceflight critical hardware. I have gained experience with RF test instruments such as signal generators, microwave amplifiers, signal analyzers, RF power sensors, and antennas. I have also learned how to automate the functioning of these instruments using a variety of methods. I've communicated with them via ethernet and USB on a variety of operating systems. I've used VISA, libusb, http transfers, and SCPI commands to interface with them. This type of automation saves enormous amounts of time when you have to run tests at a bunch of different frequencies, or with a bunch of different signals. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During high school, I had jobs at SAM and Ganz. At Ganz I worked with MDM configuration, improving their process so that you could configure many devices in parallel rather than every one serially. At SAM, I developed my communication and improvisational skills teaching math classes. I used the Singapore math curriculum, emphasizing visual learning and certain types of diagrams.
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Projects</h3>
            
                <p>
                I did a VIP at GTRI in the thin film deposition lab. I gained experience operating vacuum systems and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) setups in order to grow Indium Selenide films. We used a variety of different substrates and effusion chamber temperatures to fine tune the growth process. After growing the samples, I worked on Python code to analyze the Raman spectroscopy data in order to characterize the phase of Indium Selenide grown.

            <p>
                For my personal projects, see the Projects page of this website for detailed documentation.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Skills</h3>
            
            <p>
            I have experience with a wide variety of programming languages. The languages I am most familiar with are Python and C++, as I have built a variety of personal/professional projects with them. In my internship, I gained many software skills, especially in relation to automating test instruments. I've also taken a class on FPGA design in which we used VHDL and Quartus.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Awards and Honors</h3>
            
            <p>
            One award I've won is the STAR Student Region Winner. Most seniors in Georgia are entered into the STAR Student competition since you are automatically entered when you take the SAT. Out of those, there were only 22 region winners who made it to the state level. The competition is based on your SAT score and on a series of interviews with judges. The National Merit Finalist came from the NMSQT test and an essay. The Georgia Certificate of Merit comes from having a top 5% high school GPA in Georgia.

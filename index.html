                My name is Matthew Cargill, and I am an Electrical Engineering student at Georgia Tech. My degree specializations 
                are signal processing and sensing. I am interested in a career developing new signal processing techniques for RF
                or sensing applications. I anticipate graduating with my BS in December 2026, then participating in the BS/MS program
                adding one more year for my MS.
            </p>

                On this website you can find documentation of the personal projects I have built, links to their code repositories,
                my resume, and a detailed description of my skills/experience. You can reach me at mcargill3@gatech.edu.

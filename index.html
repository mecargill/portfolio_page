                My name is Matthew Cargill, and I am an Electrical Engineering student at Georgia Tech. My degree specializations 
                are signal processing and sensing. I aspire to a career in RF, signal processing, and/or sensing. I anticipate graduating with my BS in December 2026, then participating in the BS/MS program, adding one more year for my MS.
            </p>

            <p>
                On this website you can find documentation of the personal projects I have built, contact info, links to code repositories,
                my resume, and a detailed description of my skills/experience.
